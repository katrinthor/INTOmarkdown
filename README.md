## 1. Linux uppsetning

I decided on installing Linux via the VirtualBox and the Linux Mint VirtualBox
image. Once I compelted the installation process I had trouble going to the next
step as all I got was a blackscreen (see Startup.PNG photo). After trying repeatedly
to reinstall I looked to the discusion group on Facebook for answers. I found
a comment from the professor (october 17 10:34 pm) where he added a link to
installing Git on Windows after a discusion on the common difficulties that
students have had in installing Linux. This was thus my next step.

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

Retrieving and installing vim and git was pretty straight forward. 

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)

Using Git Gui was a little complicated as none of the instructions were intended to 
help with it. However, I used the insturctions that were given, some that I found on
the internet and some trial and error. The end result was as it should be, or so it 
would seem. I added the SSH key, had some difficulties and had to git config in my 
email and name in command propmt. After that I could finish the rest.
